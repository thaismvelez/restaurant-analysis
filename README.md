# Zomato Resturant Analysis
This project analyzes Zomato’s restaurant data to uncover factors influencing popularity and revenue, providing insights into how cuisine type and customer ratings impact overall restaurant performance.

## Data Set

The dataset for this project is provided in a zip file named **Zomato data.zip**, which contains the following five tables:

- **food:** Details about various food items available for order.
- **menu:** Information on the menus of different restaurants.
- **orders:** Transaction records detailing customer orders.
- **restaurant:** Information about the restaurants listed on Zomato.

## Introduction

Zomato is a multinational restaurant aggregator and food delivery company. In the face of growing competition, understanding the customer base remains crucial for formulating effective marketing strategies. The analysis focuses on evaluating revenue, cuisine type, and rating count to uncover what drives restaurant popularity and success on the platform.

## Project Objectives

- Analyze the business performance of Zomato’s top 10 restaurants by examining relationships between revenue, cuisine type, and rating count.
- Identify which restaurant characteristics most influence popularity and customer engagement on the platform.
- Provide data-driven insights to highlight the cuisines and restaurant traits that contribute most to revenue growth and overall success.

## Methodology

1. **Data Preparation:**

    - Import and clean the datasets to ensure accurate analysis.
    - Combine relevant datasets to create a comprehensive view of restaurant performance and key business metrics.
  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**

    - Analyze the top 10 restaurants based on total revenue to identify trends across cuisine types and rating counts.
    - Examine relationships between restaurant ratings, revenue, and popularity to uncover factors driving top performance.

3. **Restaurant Analysis**

    - Identify correlations between sales, ratings, and cuisine to determine the top 10 most popular restaurants.
    - Visualize key findings using Tableau to highlight revenue trends, cuisine performance, and restaurant popularity.
  
4. **Reporting:**

    - Prepare a comprehensive report summarizing insights on revenue, cuisine type, and restaurant ratings.
    - Present an interactive Tableau dashboard showcasing the top 10 restaurants, revenue distribution, and key performance trends.
  
## Visual Representations

The analysis includes a main dashboard designed to effectively communicate key findings and insights.

## Key Findings

1. **Revenue**

    - Top 10 restaurants each generate ~₹1.2M–1.5M in revenue showing no particular restaurant that dominates the others.
    - High revenue appears across all rating-count tiers (500+, 100+, 50+, 20+, even low counts).

2. **Cuisine**
   
    - Top earners concentrate in a few cuisine mixes (e.g., Pizzas, North Indian, Bakery/Beverages).
    - Restaurants tagged with two cuisines (e.g., Continental, Indian; Pizzas, Pastas) appear frequently in the Top 10, suggesting broader menu appeal may widen demand.
    - Different restaurants within the same cuisine show varied revenues, implying that execution (menu mix, pricing, operations) matters alongside cuisine choice.

3. **Ratings**
   
    - A few restaurants show high rating counts but only mid revenue, reinforcing that social proof alone doesn’t guarantee sales leadership.
    - Some high-revenue restaurants still have low rating counts, indicating momentum or newer listings that deserve trust badges and review nudges.
  
## Conclusion

- When popularity is measured by revenue, a small set of cuisines consistently ranks at the top and is over-represented among Top-10 restaurants.
- While review count can align with higher revenue for some restaurants, it is not a necessary or sufficient condition; top performers exist at multiple review-count levels.
- Popularity is better explained by cuisine demand and offer fit than by sheer review volume or rating level.

## Recommendations for Improvement

- Prioritize campaigns and in-app placement for high-earning cuisines (e.g., Pizzas, North Indian, Bakery/Beverages). Test cuisine-specific promos on weekends and meal peaks.
- Use “Trending,” “Repeat Favorite,” or delivery-quality badges to complement ratings; encourage reviews where revenue is rising but review volume is low.
- Map these Top-10 by area and boost courier coverage and ad spend in those zones to capture spillover demand for similar cuisines.

## Future Directions

- Conduct further analysis into customer demographics to identify specific areas how the top 10 restaurants and cuisine relate. 
- Explore additional datasets to gain deeper insights into customer preferences and behaviors.
- Implement A/B testing for marketing strategies based on the top 10 restaurants and other datasets such as users and menu.
